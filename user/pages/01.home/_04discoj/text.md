    DiSCo Journal has been laying the groundwork for this kind of exchange since its establishment in 2021. DiSCo Journal remains our frontline as a vital counter-narrative to the unedited noise of the digital and virtual culture, that wants to cut sharp from the dusty academic repository. This annual, born-digital space lets art, theory, and method collide, moving past worn-out paradigms and stale dualisms to inhabit new critical zones of hybridity and to build third understandings.
