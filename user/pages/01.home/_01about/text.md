  <p class="about-manifesto">
    We are at every moment tearing through the digital fabric that lines our daily lives; surrounded by organs without bodies, AI-generated identities, and algorithmic governance that is structuring new affective horizons.
  </p>

  <p class="about-position">
    We, the Digital Studies Collective (DiSCo), are a group of PhD researchers who navigate, engage with, and insist on shaping this emerging reality. We refuse to remain passive observers: in order to grapple with humanity’s increasing seduction of the digital, we need to organise collectively and continuously learn, lament, celebrate and critique the digitisation of the everyday. At the centre of our work is the bringing together of diverse perspectives resulting in radical transdisciplinary scholarship.

  <p class="about-proof">
    To date, we have organised nine training workshops in digital methodologies and in September 2025, we launched our first research conference, “Bodies in Digital Transition,” at Goldsmiths, University of London. The 3-day conference successfully brought together researchers, artists and technologists to explore transcultural perspectives of the digital in relation to embodied and material phenomena. As well as diverse theoretical, methodological, and philosophical approaches, we welcomed creative interventions and experimental presentation formats that stretched the boundaries of academia in unexpected ways.
